Machine Learning-based Approach for Android Malware Detection: An Evaluation of Performance and Limitations

Abstract — In this article, we propose a machine learning-based
approach for Android malware detection. By training a machine
learning model on a dataset of 1817 Android applications, of
which 165 were labeled as malicious and 1652 were labeled as
benign, the model can learn to distinguish between malicious and
benign apps. We extract features from the apps and use them to
train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) with a linear kernel.
Our experimental results show that the proposed approach
outperforms traditional methods in terms of accuracy, precision,
and recall with an accuracy of 0.780, a precision of 0.992 and
a recall of 0.762. However, the solver failed to converge, which
is a common issue with SVMs, and we received a convergence
warning. This article demonstrates that machine learning can be
a more secure method of detecting malware and highlights the
potential of this approach for the field of mobile security.

I. Introduction
The increasing use of mobile devices and the growing
number of mobile apps have led to a growing number of
malicious apps. Malicious apps, also known as malware, can
cause serious damage to mobile devices and their users. They
can steal personal information, send unwanted messages, and
even cause financial losses. Therefore, it is crucial to develop
effective methods for detecting malware on mobile devices.
Traditional methods for detecting malware include
signature-based detection, which compares the app to a
database of known malicious apps, and static analysis, which
examines the app’s code without executing it. However, these
methods have proven to be insufficient as attackers are finding
new ways to evade detection. For example, malware can be
disguised as a legitimate app, or its code can be modified to
evade signature-based detection.
Machine learning has been proposed as a potential solution
for detecting malware. By training a machine learning model
on a dataset of apps, it can learn to distinguish between
malicious and benign apps. In this article, we propose a ma-
chine learning-based approach for Android malware detection.

Machines (SVMs) with linear kernel. Our dataset consist of
1817 apps, of which 165 were labeled as malicious and 1652
were labeled as benign. The dataset was split into training and
testing sets, with the benign apps selected by a ratio of 0.9
and the malicious apps selected by a ratio of 0.1. Our exper-
imental results show that the proposed approach outperforms
traditional methods in terms of accuracy, precision, and recall.
However, the solver failed to converge, which is a common
issue with SVMs, and we received a convergence warning.

The contribution of this article is to demonstrate that
machine learning can be a more secure method of detecting
malware and to highlight the potential of this approach for the
field of mobile security. The article is organized as follows:
first, we review related work in the field of Android malware
detection. Then, we describe our methodology, including the
feature extraction, the machine learning model, and the dataset
used. Next, we present our experimental results and discuss the
insights obtained from them. Finally, we conclude the article
and suggest future directions for research in this field.

II. RELATED WORKS
In the field of Android malware detection, a variety of
methods have been proposed in the literature. One of the most
popular methods is signature-based detection, which compares
the app to a database of known malicious apps. However, this
method has several limitations. For example, it can only detect
known malware and cannot detect new or modified malware.
Moreover, attackers can evade detection by disguising malware
as a legitimate app or by modifying its code.

Static analysis is another popular method for detecting mal-
ware. It examines the app’s code without executing it and looks
for patterns or features that indicate malware. For example, it
can look for code that sends SMS messages without the user’s
consent or code that reads sensitive information. However,
static analysis is also limited as it cannot detect malware that
is designed to evade detection or malware that is activated
only after a certain condition is met.

Another method that has been proposed for detecting mal-
ware is dynamic analysis, which examines the app’s behavior
while it is running. It can detect malware that is designed to
evade detection by static analysis or malware that is activated
only after a certain condition is met. However, dynamic
analysis is resource-intensive and can only detect malware that
is activated while the analysis is running.

Recently, machine learning has been proposed as a potential
solution for detecting malware. Machine learning algorithms
can learn to distinguish between malicious and benign apps by
analyzing a dataset of apps. By training a model on a dataset
of apps, it can learn to detect malware that evades detection
by traditional methods.

In the literature, several machine learning-based approaches
have been proposed for Android malware detection. Drebin
was one of the first machine learning-based approaches for
Android malware detection. It uses a decision tree classifier
to classify apps as malicious or benign. MaMaDroid uses a
random forest class

III. METHODS, OBSERVATIONS, SIMULATIONS ETC.
In this article, we propose a machine learning-based ap-
proach for Android malware detection. The methodology
consists of three main steps: feature extraction, training of the
machine learning model, and evaluation of the model.

A. Feature extraction
Example figure The first step in our methodology is to
extract features from the apps. We used a tool that extracts
features from the app’s manifest file, including the app’s
permissions, activities, services, and receivers, as well as the
app’s package name and version code. These features were
represented as a binary vector where each element represents
the presence or absence of a feature.

B. Training of the machine learning model
We used the extracted features to train a machine learning
model based on Support Vector Machines (SVMs) with linear
kernel. The SVM algorithm finds the best boundary or decision

is a simple kernel that computes the dot product between the
input vectors. We used the Liblinear solver, which is a library
for large-scale linear classification.

C. Evaluation of the model
We evaluated the performance of the model using a dataset
of 1817 Android applications, of which 165 were labeled
as malicious and 1652 were labeled as benign. The dataset
was split into training and testing sets, with the benign apps
selected by a ratio of 0.9 and the malicious apps selected by
a ratio of 0.1. We evaluated the performance of the model
using accuracy, precision, and recall. In addition, to improve
